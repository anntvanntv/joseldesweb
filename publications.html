                Settle for Now but Block for Tomorrow: The Deterrence Effects of Merger Policy Tools</a>
            <p class="textopubli">Antitrust policy involves not just the regulation of anticompetitive behavior but also an important
                deterrence
                effect. Neither scholars nor policy makers have fully researched the deterrence effects of merger policy
                tools
                because they have been unable to empirically measure these effects. We consider the ability of different
                antitrust
                actions—blocked mergers, negotiated settlements, and monitorings—to deter firms from engaging in
                mergers. We use
                cross‐jurisdiction/pantime data on merger policy to empirically estimate the impact of antitrust actions
                on future
                merger frequencies. We find that blocked mergers lead to decreased merger notifications in subsequent
                periods and
                that negotiated settlements weakly increase future merger notifications; in other words, blocked mergers
                involve a
                deterrence effect, but negotiated settlements do not.</p>

            <p class="textopubli">This paper tests whether upstream R&D cooperation leads to downstream collusion. We show that a
                sufficient condition for identifying collusive behavior is a decline in the market share of firms
                participating in research joint ventures (RJVs). Using information from the U.S. National Cooperation
                Research Act, we estimate a market share equation correcting for the endogeneity of RJV participation
                and R&D expenditures. We find robust evidence that large networks between direct competitors, created
                through firms being members in several RJVs at the same time, are conducive to collusive outcomes in the
                product market that reduce consumer welfare. By contrast, RJVs among noncompetitors are efficiency

            <p class="textopubli">This paper proposes an explanation as to why some mergers fail, based on the interaction between the pre‐
                and post‐merger processes. We argue that failure may stem from informational asymmetries arising from
                the pre‐merger period, and problems of cooperation and coordination within recently merged firms. We
                show that a partner may optimally agree to merge and abstain from putting forth any post‐merger effort,
                counting on the other partner to make the necessary efforts. If both follow the same course of action,
                the merger goes ahead but fails. Our unique equilibrium allows us to make predictions on which mergers
                are more likely to fail. </p>

                entry: Evidence from the pharmaceutical industry</a>
            <p class="textopubli">Common ownership-where two firms are at least partially owned by the same investor-and its impact on
                product market outcomes has recently drawn a lot of attention from scholars and practitioners alike.
                Theoretical and empirical researchsuggests that common ownership can lead to higher prices. This paper
                focuses on implications for market entry. To estimate the effect of common ownership on entry decisions,
                we focus on the pharmaceutical industry. In particular, we consider the entry decisions of generic
                pharmaceutical firms into drug markets opened up by the end of regulatory protection in the US. We first
                provide a theoretical framework that shows that a higher level of common ownership between the brand
                firm (incumbent) and potential generic entrant reduces the generic's incentives to entry. We provide
                robust evidence for this prediction. The effect is large: a one-standard-deviation increase in common
                ownership decreases the probability of generic entry by 9-13%. We extend our basic theoretical framework
                and allow for multiple entrants. Our model shows that for sufficiently high levels of common ownership,
                the classical idea of entry decisions being strategic substitutes can be reversed into being strategic
                complements. Our empirical results provide some support for these predictions.</p>

            <p class="textopubli">
                We estimate the deterrence effects of US merger policy instruments with respect to the composition and
                frequency of future merger notifications. Data from the Annual Reports by the US Department of Justice
                and Federal Trade Commission allow industry-based measures over the 1986–99 period of the conditional
                probabilities for eliciting investigations, challenges, prohibitions, court wins, and court losses:
                Deterrence variables akin to the traditional conditional probabilities from the economics of crime
                literature. We find the challenge rate to robustly deter future horizontal (both relative and absolute)
                merger activity, and the court-loss rate to moderately affect absolute levels of horizontal-merger
                activity; however, the investigation rate, prohibition rate, and court-win rate do not significantly
                deter future horizontal mergers. Accordingly, the conditional probability of eliciting an antitrust

            <p class="textopubli">
                The change from analogue to digital technologies in the mobile telecom industries at the beginning of
                the 1990s increased the economic rationale for rendering these markets more competitive. Yet, the speed
                of reforms have been remarkably different across countries. We empirically investigate this
                cross-sectional and temporal variation in entry liberalization of OECD countries during the 1990s. A
                unique data set obtained by merging different sources on political, government and regulatory
                institutions – as well as private interests and ideologies – allows us to explore in detail several
                dimensions of the political economy of liberalization. Our findings indicate majoritarian electoral
                systems as important drivers for change, while independent industry regulators slow down such reforms.
                Furthermore, powerful industry incumbents hold up the liberalization process and governing bodies that
                favor a small welfare state accelerate it. The focus on separate elements of countries’ institutions
                aims to shed light on the underlying structure of decision-making processes, providing a base for more

            <p class="textopubli">We analyse the effects of investment decisions and firms' internal organisation on the efficiency and
                stability of horizontal mergers. In our framework efficiency gains are endogenous and there might be
                internal conflict within merged firms. We show that, both with and without conflict, stable mergers
                often do not generate efficiency gains. In the case of internal conflict, mergers may even lead to
                efficiency losses. Our welfare results suggest that antitrust authorities may approve welfare-reducing
                mergers (type II error) and block welfare-enhancing mergers (type I error) if they assume that potential
                efficiency gains will always be realised. In addition, the paper offers a possible explanation for

            <p class="textopubli">The aim of this paper is to empirically test the determinants of Research Joint Ventures’ (RJVs) group
                dynamics. We develop a model based on learning and transaction cost theories, which represent the
                benefits and costs of RJV participation, respectively. According to our framework, firms at each period
                in time weigh the benefits against the costs of being an RJV member. RJV dynamics can then be
                interpreted as a consequence of this evolving trade-off over time. We look at entry, turbulence and exit
                in RJVs that have been set up under the US National Cooperative Research Act, which allows for certain
                antitrust exemptions in order to stimulate firms to co-operate in R&D. Accounting for unobserved project

            <p class="textopubli">We estimate the deterrence effects of European Commission (EC) merger policy instruments over the
                1990–2009 period. Our empirical results suggest phase‐1 remedies uniquely generate robust deterrence
                as—unlike phase‐1 withdrawals, phase‐2 remedies, and preventions—phase‐1 remedies lead to fewer merger
                notifications in subsequent years. Furthermore, the deterrence effects of phase‐1 remedies work best in
                high‐concentration industries, that is, industries where the Herfindahl Hirschman Index is above the 0.2
                cut‐off level employed by the EC. Additionally, we find phase‐1 remedies do not deter clearly
                pro‐competitive mergers, but do deter potentially anti‐competitive mergers in high‐concentration

                In our paper, the target of a proposed merger, by setting a reserve price, is able to screen prospective
                acquirers according to their (expected) ability to generate merger-specific synergies. Both empirical
                evidence and many merger models suggest that the difference between high and low-synergy mergers becomes
                smaller during booms. Thus, a target's opportunity cost for sorting out relatively less fitting
                acquirers increases and, hence, targets screen less tightly during booms, which leads to a hike in
                merger activity. Our screening mechanism not only predicts that merger activity is intense during booms
                and subdued during recessions but is also consistent with other stylized facts about takeovers and
                generates novel testable predictions.</p>

                We investigate patterns in common ownership networks between firms that are active in the U.S.
                pharmaceutical industry for the period 2004–2014. Our main findings are that “brand firms”—that is,
                firms that have research and development capabilities and launch new drugs—exhibit relatively dense
                common ownership networks with each other that further increase significantly in density over time,
                whereas the network of “generic firms”—that is, firms that primarily specialize in developing and
                launching generic drugs—is much sparser and stays that way over the span of our sample. Finally, when
                considering the common ownership links between brands firms, on the one hand, and generic firms, on the
                other, we find that brand firms have become more connected to generic firms over time. We discuss the

                take in responding to productivity threats, questions regarding which transformational strategies are
                commonly employed and commonly successful have been neglected. Answering these broader questions allows
                factoring how firms might respond to new-normal conditions; and yields normative implications regarding
                the transformational strategies – and policies – that enhance productivity growth and reverse new-normal
                stagnation. Using cross-industry panel data, we identify the transformational strategies that are both
                commonly employed and commonly successful. Our empirical results indicate that firms react to
                productivity threats via a variety of strategic responses; yet, engaging in renewal and recombination
                uniquely address such threats.</p>

                Lower Saxony aimed at supporting the deployment of basic broadband infrastructure in rural Germany. Such
                subsidies are subject to state aid control by the European Commission and may only be granted if the
                potential market failure is addressed without distorting competition. We first analyse the consequences
                of the subsidies on reducing the digital divide between urban and rural areas. Second, and more novel,
                we examine the impact on different measures of competition: market entry and the resulting effect on
                prices and broadband offerings. We use an instrumental variables (IV) approach based on the interaction
                between technical features of the programme and political cycles in order to exploit plausibly exogenous
                variation in the allocation of subsidies. We find that the subsidies significantly increased broadband
                coverage. More interestingly, the number of internet service providers (ISPs) increased significantly in
                municipalities that received subsidies, which, in turn, led to a relative increase in the number of
                local broadband plans and a relative decrease in average prices. Our results show that well-designed
                state aid need not distort competition and can even enhance it.</p>

                Building on the framework developed by Bloom et al. (2013) which considers the opposing effects of

                Since the firm’s decision to join a RJV is endogenous, we build a model of RJV participation. The

            <p class="textopubli">We provide a description of ownership patterns in the top 25 European banks for the period 2003–2015,
                where we especially focus on the global financial crisis. Investment managers, such as Blackrock, are
                dominant in terms of number of blockholdings in different banks, maintaining fairly stable “common
                ownership” networks throughout our sample. However, the financial crisis led to capital injections by
                governments in several banks in trouble, which in turn led to a jump in holdings by governments, which
                typically are “non-common owners” (i.e., they hold only shares in only one bank). This jump translated
                into these investors temporarily being the top investor with a large share, and non-common owners being
                the majority among large shareholders. A brief comparison with US banks uncovers large ownership
                differences between the European and US banking sectors. We briefly discuss what these ownership
                patterns might imply for competition, stability and performance in the banking industry.</p>

            <P class="textopubli">Deregulation typically comes with redistribution of rents and thus with opposition from the losing
                interest groups. We show that, by exploiting complementarities, synchronising deregulation across
                markets makes this opposition lower. Indeed, a particular deregulation may reduce rents for one interest

                way out of the ‘sclerosis’ of especially European markets. For this effect, we build a microeconomic
                model based on two assumptions: Cournot competition à la Vives in the product markets and firms hiring
                workers in accordance with an efficiency wage in the labour markets. As being particularly relevant for
                European economies, we focus on product market regulation that determines the degree of market

            <p class="textopubli">This study examines whether EU competition policy enforcement has led to stronger competition in European
                gas and electricity markets and hence lower prices, higher investment and improved productivity.
                Specifically, the study analyses the impact of competition policy enforcement on shortrun measures of
                intensity of competition such as profit elasticity and productivity dispersion (at sectorcountry level);
                and medium and long-term competitive outcomes such as investment and productivity (at
                firm-sector-country level). The main result of this analysis is that EU merger policy enforcement is
                consistently and significantly related to better market outcomes, especially in low-regulated markets.
                The impacts of the EU’s anti-trust enforcement and state aid control on the other hand, are not
                statistically significant. The study also empirically evaluates the price effects of two individual

                Decision, by affecting competition in the EEX, led to a reduction in Wholesale electricity prices in

                of competition policy enforcement in light of the main changes in the functioning of the telecoms

                und Geld besteht und typischerweise mit der Größe ihrer Firma steigt. Dennoch kann dieser Ansatz nicht

                markups. We empirically confirm these relationships for public US firms in the years 2004-2012, where
                the financial crisis coincides with passive investors’ rise. The found effects are small but
                non-negligible.</p>

                Services: Do Lawyers Offer What Clients Want?</a>
            <p class="textopubli">We analyze clients’ contract choices in auctions where Dutch law firms compete for standard cases such as
                labor disputes for individuals and collecting debts for businesses. In the auctions, lawyers can submit
                bids with any fee arrangement they prefer, including an hourly rate, a fixed fee, and a ‘mixed fee’: a
                time-capped fixed fee plus an hourly rate for any additional hours should the case take longer than
                expected. A game-theoretic analysis of this auction format reveals that clients should accept only
                fixed-fee bids in equilibrium. We estimate a simultaneous equation model that includes both the client’s
                and lawyers’ side. Qualitatively in line with our theoretical prediction, we find that clients strongly
                prefer fixed fees. Our results suggest that selecting a lawyer through an auction may benefit clients
                who face an incidental legal problem. More generally, our findings tentatively contradict lawyers’ often

            <p class="textopubli">The deployment of a safe and effective vaccine for Covid-19 will be central to lifting containment
                measures. In a bid to speed up vaccine deployment, governments are entering into 'Advance Purchase
                Agreements' (APAs) with vaccine companies to secure access to vaccine doses. We document and compare the
                vaccine procurement strategies of the US and the EU. Most notably, we find that both the US and the EU
                only secure vaccine doses from developers whose (contracted) production facilities are based in US or EU
                territory, respectively. Securing vaccine production on home soil is crucial in a crisis because of the
                ability of governments to implement export restrictions; vaccines produced in a different jurisdiction
                may be blocked from exiting the region. Thus, only governments who can secure local production will be
                able to provide a vaccine quickly.</p>

                Essays on Competition and Innovation in the Pharmaceutical Industry; Essays over concurrentie en
                innovatie in de farmaceutische industrie</a>
            <p class="textopubli">Innovation is essential for progress, long-term growth, and consumer welfare. As such, there is almost a
                universal consensus among economists that innovation must be not only protected but promoted. However,
                research remains unclear as regards the role competition plays in pursuing this goal. The relationship
                between competition and innovation is complex and ambiguous (Aghion et al., 2005; Shapiro, 2011).
                Discussions are thus still ongoing regarding policies that policy makers and competition authorities
                should adopt to spur innovation. Using the setting of one of the most important and innovative
                sectors-the pharmaceutical industry and R&D for the treatment of diabetes in particular-this
                dissertation deepens our understanding and brings important empirical insights to these academic and
                policy debates by focusing on two specific topics. The first topic, covering two chapters, studies how
                changes in the competitive landscape through mergers and acquisitions (M&As) affect innovation. The
                chapters show that the so far unexplored technological uncertainty (early stages) and technological
                characteristics of projects are an essential part of the changing-of-ownership stories. Market power,
                dominating all ongoing debates, is only a small part of what is ongoing in pharmaceutical M&As. The key
                to uncover richer patterns and obtain a much more comprehensive understanding of the implications of
                M&As for innovation in the pharma sector hinges on considering technological uncertainty, presence and
                closeness between the merging parties in both product and technology markets. From the policy
                perspective, the presented empirical evidence …</p>

                Industry</a>
            <p class="textopubli">This dissertation consists of four essays which advance our understanding of the pharmaceutical industry
                and how to effectively regulate this sector. Each chapter aims to provide new insights, which are
                relevant for policymakers, based on rigorous economic analysis of real-world data. The chapters in this
                dissertation focus on the US pharmaceutical industry; the largest market for pharmaceutical products in
                the world in terms of value. The first essay in this dissertation studies voting behavior in the FDA’s
                advisory committees which vote on questions related to the approval of new drugs. The second essay
                investigates the determinants of the market entry decisions of pharmaceutical firms that produce generic
                medicines. In particular, it investigates whether ownership links between generic manufacturers and the
                originator (or brand) firm created by “common investors”(investors that own shares in both the brand and
                generic firm) affect the likelihood that a generic drug will be launched on the market. The third essay
                investigates the presence of ownership links created by large shareholders in the pharmaceutical
                industry more broadly, using tools from network analysis, and discusses how common ownership may affect
                product market outcomes in the sector. The final essay studies the extent to which promotional gifts and
                other transfers made to physicians by pharmaceutical companies influences the prescription decisions of
                physicians and how this affects healthcare costs.</p>

                their operations in markets</a>
            <p class="textopubli">The aim of this thesis is broadening the reach of economic research on mergers and industry dynamics,
                pointing out that mergers are not only done because of firms' needs and do not only create effects in
                firms' markets. Indeed, dynamics are largely driven by managers and have their impact on employees. We
                have created some situations were internal functioning and external operating of firms interact. The
                first chapter claims that if employees in a firm block law reforms that could hurt them, then
                intervening also in the way how firms should compete in their markets may create positive effects for
                employees, making them in the end to agree on reforms. Combining reforms creates positive externalites,
                which if well used can lower resisitance for necessary changes. This is because reforms in the labour
                and product markets are complementary, and therefore the loosing side of one reform will be the winning
                side of the other reform. Also, reforms in both markets increase welfare more than a single reform and
                show thus synergy effects. Moreover, it offers a possible way out of the so called "sclerosis" effect.
                When frictions in markets are high, interest groups enjoy higher rents and oppose more reforms and thus
                the markets that need most a reform, are most stuck in a sclerosis. But high frictions in one market
                make it easier to reform the other market and therefore the sclerosis in one market can cancel out the
                sclerosis in the other market. In the second chapter we reconsider the market power-effciency trade-off
                made by competition authorities and stress the importance of both strategic decision making of managers
                and internal organisation issues after …</p>
